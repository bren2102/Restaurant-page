# Restaurant Page

> Javascript application using ES6 and webpack. In this app you use what you’ve learned and take a chance to continue practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage. By the end, you are going to be using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website.
